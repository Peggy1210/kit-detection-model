Detection Kit Result Classifier
===

## Introduction

In our project, we designed a detection kit for colorectal cancer diagnosis. In order to enhance the user experience of our product, we developed a set of hardware and trained machine learning models to help recognize the results. This repository is the source code for the machine learning model. Visit our [project website](https://2023.igem.wiki/nthu-taiwan/hometext) to see more of our project!

## Files

There are two directories in this repository, `PCRD_model` and `AUNP_model`. The files under these directories follow this architecture:

```
|__ dataset/
|   |___ # Images of detection kit (`.HEIC` file)
|__ process_heic.ipynb # Convert `.HEIC` files to `.JPG` files
|
|   # Two-step models
|__ preprocess_model.ipynb # 1st step model
|__ auto_label.csv # 1st step model labels
|__ result_model # 2nd step model
|__ color_label.csv # 2nd step model labels
|
|   # Single-step model
|__ single_model.ipynb
|__ multi_label.csv # single-step model labels
```

## Run

### Process

![](https://github.com/Peggy1210/iGEM-ML-Model/blob/main/mlmodels.png)

We built our machine learning in approaches, single-step and two-step methods.

In the Two-Step model, there are two sub-models, the preprocessing model and the result-recognizing model. The preprocessing model will determine whether the photo the user has just taken is valid, that is, the detection kit is in the middle of the photo and is not covered by any objects. Next, the result-recognizing model will tell the result based on the valid image.

Combining the function of the Two-Step model, the single model will tell whether the image is valid and the result of diagnosis in just one step.

The following describes the corresponding file and details of the training.

#### Convert Image File Type

* Run `process_heic.ipynb` to convert `HEIC` files to `JPG` files.
* The converted images will be saved under the directory `training_data/`.
* `auto_label.csv` will be automatically generated with a corresponding number of labels, and will be used later for training.

#### Two-Step Model

##### **First step**
* Run `preprocess_mode.ipynb`.
* The label used in this step was written in `auto_label.csv`
* This file has three models, including linear regression, random forest, and convolution neural network.
* The best model will be saved in `preprocess_model.tflite` for later use in the app.

##### **Second step**
* Run `result_model.ipynb`.
* The label used in this step was written in `color_label.csv`
* This file has three models, including linear regression, random forest, and convolution neural network.
* The best model will be saved in `result_model.tflite` for later use in the app.

#### Single Step Model
* Run `preprocess_model.ipynb`.
* The label used in this step was written in `multi_label.csv`
* This file has three models, including linear regression, random forest, and convolution neural network.
* The best model will be saved in `single_model.tflite` for later use in the app.
